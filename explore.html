       <h2>Our Exhibitions</h2>
       <p>
        We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits. 
        This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. 
        Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life 
        (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).

                Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, 
                explores the night sky and what we can see and

            <h3>Evolution</h3>
            <h4>Discover the origins of life</h4>
            <p>
                For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with 
                the question of our origins.  
                Where do we come from and how did we get here?    
            </p>
            <p>
                Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a 
                framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.

                Take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our 
                "Woolly Mammoth", the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

            <h3>Biology and Medicine</h3>
            <h4>Explore the history of medicine</h4>
            <p>
                For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life
                much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine.   
            </p>
            <img src="images/x-ray.jpg" alt="x-ray of a hand forming a circle with the thumb and index finger">
            <p>
                From micro-organisms to the human body, 
                major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights 
                into the great wonders of the tiny world. 
            </p>
            <img src="images/heart.jpg" alt="image of a plastic heart with the colours red, white, blue and yellow">
            <p>
                Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a 
                look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin 
                and the first heart transplant. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, 
                but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures 
                have beat us to it.

            <h3>Ecology</h3>
            <h4>Explore how to create a sustainable future</h4>
            <p>
                As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, 
                the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a 
                sustainable future   
            </p>

            <p>
                Not just for humans but for the whole planet.
            </p>
            <p>
                In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack 
                the dangers we currently face...

                ...including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution.
            </p>
            <p>
                But we also focus on the positive ways 
                we can all contribute to a brighter future.
