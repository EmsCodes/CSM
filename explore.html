       <h2>Our Exhibitions</h2>
       <p>
        We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits. 
        This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. 
        Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life 
        (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).

            <h3>Evolution</h3>
            <h4>Discover the origins of life</h4>
            <p>
                For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with 
                the question of our origins.  
                Where do we come from and how did we get here?    
            </p>
            <p>
                Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a 
                framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.

                "Woolly Mammoth", the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.
