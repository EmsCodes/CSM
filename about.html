        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>
            At the Community Science Museum where we’re committed to
            making science accessible to all.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a community-driven museum, 
            we want to work with schools to create places of learning and exploring.
        </p>
        <p>
            The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can 
            experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps 
            even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of 
            the world around us.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, 
            but brought to live through exhibits.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of 
            science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to 
            interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the 
            dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).
        </p>
