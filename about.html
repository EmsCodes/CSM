        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>
            At the Community Science Museum where we’re committed to
            making science accessible to all.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a community-driven museum, 
            we want to work with schools to create places of learning and exploring.
        </p>
        <p>
            The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can 
            experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps 
            even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of 
            the world around us.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, 
            but brought to live through exhibits.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of 
            science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to 
            interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the 
            dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).

            <h2>Get involved</h2>
            <h3>Support</h3>
            <p>
                There are various ways you can support the museum.
            </p>
            <p>
                Donations are very welcome and are an important 
                way we keep this museum open and accessible to the whole community.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also support us by donating items of interest to 
                the museum’s collections.
        <h2>Volunteer</h2>
            <p>
                Are you looking to get involved with our team of researchers 
                and academics? 
            </p>
            <p>
                Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes 
                of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is also a monthly 
                lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas for 
                future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
            </p>
        <h3>Researchers</h3>

            <h3>Internship</h3>
            <p>
                Are you interested in working in a museum? 
                Do you enjoy the fun and excitement of sharing the wonders of 
                nature with people? 
            </p>

                and people who are passionate about science and sharing it 
                with the wider community.
